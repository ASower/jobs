# [tech256](https://tech256.com) Jobs Board

## Getting Started

Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/tech256/jobs/issues) for who is hiring and available candidates.
Listings are organized using labels.
Feel free to create a new issue if you have a position to fill, are actively looking for work, or just want to passively be included as available for hire.
We will try to keep the data fresh by periodically pinging "old" issues for current status.

Have questions? Ask.
